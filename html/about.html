    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        I enjoy going to the movies and watching a lot of TV shows. When I'm not on the couch, I indulge in some window shopping. Lately, I've taken up thrifting, finding it to be a more environmentally friendly way to shop. Whenever I'm traveling, I make it a point to explore local thrift stores. During my visit to Arizona earlier this year, I stumbled upon a beautifully aged Prada handbag, though it was too expensive to acquire. If I had an unlimited budget, I'd undoubtedly indulge in shopping for vintage luxury items.

Despite my deep concern for the environment, I can't resist the allure of high fashion. The fashion era I truly adore is the 90s, particularly with the iconic Chanel suitsâ€”they were super cute! I also have a great appreciation for Alexander McQueen and his innovative designs.
I can talk about fashion all day like it's nobody's business. However, when I go to school, you wouldn't know that I'm into fashion. It's super hard to put a stylish outfit together at 7 AM when you are barely awake.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        When I'm not in school, I enjoy traveling and capturing moments through photography. I specialize in film photography, owning multiple cameras, and I am always eager to expand my collection. Recently, I've furthered my skills by delving into the fascinating process of developing my own film.
