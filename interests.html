As a kid, Pokémon was my childhood. I'd watch the show religiously, glued to the screen as Ash and Pikachu journeyed through their world. But it wasn't just TV. I had Pokémon bouncy balls, stuffed animals, and yoyo's. They went with me everywhere, symbolizing the Pokémon craze that swept through my childhood. Pokémom was for us.
